"""Tool for uploading Google Code issues to GitHub.

  Issue migration from Google Code to GitHub.
  This tools allows you to easily move your downloaded Google Code issues to
  GitHub.

  To use this tool:
  1. Follow the instructions at https://code.google.com/p/support-tools/ to
     download your issues from Google.
  2. Go to https://github.com/settings/applications and create a new "Personal
     Access Token".
  3. Get the GitHub username of the owner of the repository and the repositories
     name you wish to add the issues to. For example username: TheDoctor and
     repository: SonicScrewdriver
  4. (Optional) If this option is skipped all issues will be assigned to the
     owner of the repo.  Make a file that contains a mapping from the Google
     Code email address to the GitHub username for each user you wish to assign
     issues too.  The file should be newline seperated with one user per line.
     The email address and username should be colon (':') seperated. For example
     a file may look like this:
       <Google Code Email>:<GitHub Username>
       myemail@gmail.com:coolperson
       otheruser@gmail.com:userother
  5. Then run the command:
       python ./issue_migration.py \
         --github_oauth_token=<oauth-token> \
         --github_owner_username=<your-github-username> \
         --github_repo_name=<repository-name> \
         --issue_file_path=<path-to-issue-file> \
         --assignee_file_path="<optional-path-to-user-mapping-file>"
